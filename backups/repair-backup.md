# Repair Bad GPG Key that is blocking Docker Desktop

In importing my old /home folder to my new linux I made a boo boo.
The problem seems to be that I imported both:
- a key to which I had forgotten the password
- Docker Desktop settings

I need to re-run a backup which excludes the problem key and the problem docker settings.

My next backup /home should exclude:

.docker


Did I pull in my docker settings from before?
Look on old SSD is it there?
