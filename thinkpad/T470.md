Has Nvidia GeForce 940X with 2GB vram
To find out which driver is needed:\
`$ ubuntu-drivers devices`
Look for teh "recommended" option
In my case it recommends Nvidia530
This appears to be only for Quadro, NOT for GeForce

Searching on Nvidia.com, it says 
[Linux x64 v525](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/204837/en-us/)

 V525 is available in MUON
 
Installed: `nvidia-graphics-drivers-525`

To benchmark the card, here's a [tutorial](https://linuxconfig.org/benchmark-your-graphics-card-on-linux)
I didn't do this because it requires other stuff like gdebi and php7.


# Driver Monitoring
In **System Settings** go to the **Driver Manager**

There is also an Nvidia GUI in Start, which I don't know how to use yet.
