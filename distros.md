# Distro Notes

## Kali
Kali is for hackers. It comes with a bunch of tools, mostly command line, for hacking, defending, or sleuthing.

You can choose which desktop env you want at install. xFCE (default, Gnome, Plasma. Xfce is pretty barebones.

Pros:
it has an undercover mode which makes it look just like Win10 right down to the C: prompt.

Cons:
The installer doesn't seem to work with btrfs. It crashed every time I tried to use btrfs. It worked fine with ext4. I didn't see a package manager. It seems to be built by a for-profit information security company.


## Pop OS

It's a very slick looking desktop which has the look and feel of MacOS. It has auto tiling for open programs, which is not as useful as I'd hoped.

Pros:
Very easy to install. Has a lot of tasks such as installing .debs abstracted away. It has an app store with a lot of common Linux apps laid out in a nice-looking searchable icon format.

Cons:
All the extras make it **slow**. It doesn't seem to have a robust package manager such as Muon. There isn't an obvious power off button in software.
