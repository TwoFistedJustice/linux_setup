# Distro Notes

## Kali
Kali is for hackers. It comes with a bunch of tools, mostly command line, for hacking, defending, or sleuthing.

You can choose which desktop env you want at install. xFCE (default, Gnome, Plasma. Xfce is pretty barebones.

Pros:
it has an undercover mode which makes it look just like Win10 right down to the C: prompt.

Cons:
The installer doesn't seem to work with btrfs. It crashed every time I tried to use btrfs. It worked fine with ext4. I didn't see a package manager. It seems to be built by a for-profit information security company.
