# Install from Muon

- Filezilla
- Finger
- Ranger (A super slim file manager that lets you navigate using arrow keys and shows you contents of files. )

# Install From Bash
- `sudo apt install bat` - like 'cat' but with color coding


## Where to put tarballed applications
- Install to `home/$user/bin`
- Some will be in a sub-directory, others such as diylc will be just a .sh file


## Things I've tried that weren't as useful as I'd hoped
- Yakuake - the drop down bash window. Mostly it gets in the way.
- Stacer - System dashboard. Nice idea but way too buggy. The memory meter gets wonky fast.
- Vim - Yes it's very efficient. But I prefer Nano because it has a visible interface.
- Timeshift - automatic backup program. It works, for a while till it doesn't.
