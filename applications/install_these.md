- `sudo apt install bat` - like 'cat' but with color coding


## Things I've tried that weren't as useful as I'd hoped
- Yakuake - the drop down bash window. Mostly it gets in the way.
- Stacer - System dashboard. Nice idea but way too buggy. The memory meter gets wonky fast.
- Vim - Yes it's very efficient. But I prefer Nano because it actually has a visible interface.
